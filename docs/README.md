# AS4 Connector

The AS4 [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to send and receive payloads via the AS4 messaging protocol. The AS4 connector is compliant with the AS4 minimal client conformance profile defined in the [AS4 profile of ebMS 3.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/os/AS4-profile-v1.0-os.html). It allows exchanging any type of payload (e.g., XML, JSON, Binary) as SOAP attachments or SOAP body payloads.
## Getting started
To get started, go to [Working with the AS4 Connector](config.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.
